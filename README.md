# ETR-Backtest-Python

To run the python program, please use the following steps:
1. Open the command line and download the required packages using the following line of code: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Modify the filepaths under the parameters named "source_file", "spReturns_file", and "ftecReturns_file" in the parameters.py file, making sure to properly escape back slashes on Windows and insert the filepath between quotes. Other numerical parameters can also be modified in the parameters.py file if desired.
3. Run "Quant Insights.py" in the python interpreter.
4. If desired, clients can export final datasets to various formats by using the methods provided in the "pandas" package in Python. 


Please  use Python 3.7+ 64-bit, as 32-bit does not allocate enough memory for the functions required.
